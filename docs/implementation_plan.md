# PRD Generation Plan

I will create 4 comprehensive Product Requirement Documents (PRDs) in Markdown format, corresponding to the user's assignment tasks. These can be exported to PDF by the user.

## Proposed Documents

### 1. [NEW] `PRD_FrontEnd_Task1_Login.md`
- **Scope:** Login Page creation based on Adobe XD design.
- **Key Sections:** Design Fidelity, Responsive Behavior, Form Validation.

### 2. [NEW] `PRD_FrontEnd_Task2_PostsApp.md`
- **Scope:** React App with List, Create, and Detail views.
- **Key Sections:** API Integration (JSONPlaceholder), Pagination Logic, Routing, State Management.

### 3. [NEW] `PRD_FrontEnd_Task3_ShoppingCart.md`
- **Scope:** Shopping Cart with Quantity and Discount logic.
- **Key Sections:** Client-side State, Math Logic (Discounts/Totals), Product Data Handling.

### 4. [NEW] `PRD_BackEnd_NestJS.md`
- **Scope:** NestJS Task Management API.
- **Key Sections:** Database Schema (Task/Team), Authentication (JWT), API Endpoints, TypeORM usage.

## Verification Plan
- **Review:** I will verify that each PRD covers all requirements listed in the user's prompt (Acceptance Criteria mapping).
- **Format:** Ensure valid Markdown formatting.
